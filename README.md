# LiverCirrhosisPrediction

This is a supervised multiclass classification task in Python with the aim to predict liver cirrhosis status using real-world data from Kaggle.


## Purpose

This project is a group work with equal contributions of all five members and was developed as part of my coursework at the University of St Andrews. It was created to fulfill the requirements of a specific assignment. 
The suggested approach is an exemplary Machine Learning workflow with Python that does not claim to be complete or correct.

By including this project in my portfolio, I aim to demonstrate my skills in Machine Learning and in contributing in group projects. It serves as an example of my work to potential employers and collaborators.

My primary contribution in this project was data analysis.
